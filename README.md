# _remove_origin

USING THE WEB INTERFACE ~ 
Concluded that it is NOT possible to EASILY delete or remove the repo.

Maybe there is a way, ... BUT is NOT easy to find.

ONLY other option is to DELETE the github account, (gdanson).

Going to keep it for now, ... might be useful to experiment with.


THE PROBLEM ::

The reason that I need to REMOVE origin, ...

The github Desktop application continues to maintain "origin" as MASTER.

TRY ~ Settings | Account ~ CHANGE gdanson to grdbiz (ACCOUNT) ~ 

IF that FAILs ~ DELETE the github account named gdanson.

IT DID FAIL ~ Have now DELETED the gdanson account, ... DELETED the local-version of the repo (origin)

APP ~ github Desktop continues to display a column with "origin"

OK ~ Close and reboot the computer.

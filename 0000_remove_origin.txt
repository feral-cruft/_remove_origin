The application called "GitHub Desktop" insists on having the "FIRST-Repro-EVER-Created" (NAMED origin). ~ Never liked THAT name, ... But various tutorial implied that,  THIS is the way must be.

NOW() GitHubdesktop will NOT let that repo GO.

Somehow,  that first repos is "The MASTER" of everything github on the local machine.

TEST - The "Merge-ing" features ~ (Along with the DELETE features of github ?).
